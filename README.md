## Overview

This application is build using the Next Js framework and the design ui is from figma.
I built it merely as a test application to see and learn how to use Next Js the react framework.
I learnt the pitfalls of bad project structure and not arranging my css classes well.
I also saw the advantages of using tailwind as a css framework since it you get to work on the css and see the changes immediately.
Using BEM and react is hard since of the component structure of react.
For example once you already give a specific component its class name then break away from its parent which has another class name it becomes hard to style the elements as the classes are separate.
But I do feel that SASS can come to the rescue in such a situation.
